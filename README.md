## Description

Games are already a massive craze among web3 users. The word betting often comes with a tag of luck. Why not get a chance to win prize by running your mind on a 10K RPM. The community we serve is already competitive when it comes to games such as chess. Our idea was to extend the thrill of these users by making them stake an amount before the game and play to win double the amount with the help of intellectual games. The real catch is: Players mutually decide the amount they are willing to stake.
